## Game Architecture and Challenges


Connect 4 is a game where players attempt to make a line of four pieces in a 7 x 6 grid. Players can drop their pieces into columns, so that their piece rests in the lowest available space in that column.

The winner is the first to create a line of four in any direction, including diagonally. If the board is filled before a line of 4 can be made, the game is declared a draw.

**Grid creation:**

 - JavaScript grid utilised to create the grid size rather than just multiple div's built into the HTML

**Checking the board for a winning move after every turn:**

-   utilising while loops to check the areas on the grid there might be player moves
-   

**Checking diagonally across the board:**

-   Index of 36 -5 must be checked throughout
-   Index of 0 - 41 must also be checked for winning moves!
-   

## Future improvements

-   CPU intelligent moves
-   Difficulty levels of the game 
-    Option to change your own colour
-   Game rule page
